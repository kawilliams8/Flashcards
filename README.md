# FlashCards
Flashcards - Turing Mod 2 FEE individual project

Flashcards is the first project in Mod 2 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The author is a student in the 1904 Cohort.

## Learning Goals
Flashcards is a multiple choice quiz game that runs on the command line interface. The player is presented a question with three possible answers. After they choose, they are informed if they guessed correctly. The questions in the game's dataset all pertain to prototype methods and general JavaScript vocabulary.

The Flashcards project is designed to reinforce the principles of Test Driven Developement, as introduced in the Mythical Creatures project of Mod 1 at Turing. This project also builds on our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, and is our first project that links several files with separate classes. Students were provided a 'starter kit' to work from, and tasked with writing most of the tests and classes/methods. This project also requires proficient use of Git and GitHub to track feature changes.

This project includes three extentions beyond the required iterations: a second dataset written by the author, implementation of the second dataset for a second round of the game, and a timer that captures and displays how long it took to complete a each round.
